/**
 * VibeMon state/theme definitions for the 3D engine (vibemon-engine-3d.js).
 *
 * Pure data + math — no three.js import — so a consumer's test runner can
 * load it in a sandbox and guard the invariants: every registry state has an
 * animation and every move name is implemented. Character colors are not
 * here; they live in each registry entry's `theme` (data/characters.json).
 *
 * The character is a digital vibe monster: a squishy horned creature with a
 * spade tail and a "vibe flame" burning above its head. The flame is the
 * session's energy made visible — each state sets a `vibe` level that
 * drives the flame's size and flicker plus the tail sway. State motion is
 * creature behavior (gazing around, waving, tail-tapping, scanning,
 * circling, pulsing, coiling, popping up, pirouetting, nodding off,
 * sinking, shivering, darting glances) — except working, which mimes a
 * furious typing frenzy.
 *
 * Pose values are sparse Euler rotations (radians) per joint, applied on
 * top of the rig's rest pose. Moves are named procedural oscillators the
 * engine implements (MOVE vocabulary below); they layer additive motion
 * over the blended pose each frame.
